Download the code and the dependencies from requirements.txt file and then Run the command - python app.py

Objective & Scope
● Exact data about the history of harvest yield is significant for settling on choices identified with rural hazard and the executives and future expectations. In the status quo, the farmers and the consumers find it difficult in the real world to determine the accurate prices of crops without having prior knowledge of the fluctuating trend prices or weather conditions.
● The proposed framework targets foreseeing the crops price by learning the previous information of the prices and weather conditions.
● Since the interaction of the farmers is a challenge due to the long distance this system will help them in connecting together. It aims at reducing the cost incurred by the farmer to the end user.
● It will forecast weather using the weather API. This will be a user-friendly project which provides the information guide in regional language
● The system comes with a model to be precise and accurate in predicting crop price and deliver the end-user with proper recommendations about the required fertilizer ratio based on atmospheric and soil parameters of the land which enhances farmer revenue.
● We are also providing a shopbot to buy the recommended fertilizers and the necessary cultivating related items.
● There will be a chatbot where farmers can communicate to tackle their queries. It also aims at reducing the cost incurred by the farmer to the end-user.
● We are providing some informative videos for proper understanding.
